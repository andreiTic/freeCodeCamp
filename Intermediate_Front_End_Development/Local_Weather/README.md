# Show the Local Weather 

###Objective: 
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

- [x] User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

- [x] User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

- [x] User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

- [x] We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.
